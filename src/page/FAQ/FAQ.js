                    Tezos has its own token standard, known as the Tezos Coin
                    Standard (or TCS). The TCS defines how tokens can be
                    transferred between accounts and how they can interact with
                    smart contracts. To simplify, FA2 Token is a token standard
                    on Tezos.
